# ðŸ”¢ Bitwise Operations in Java

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the use of **bitwise operators** â€” AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) â€” using two integers.

## ðŸ“„ Program Overview

The program performs the following:

- Bitwise AND operation between `a = 91` and `b = 84`
- Bitwise OR operation
- Bitwise XOR operation  
It then prints the results to the console.

## ðŸ§  Bitwise Operators Explained

| Operator | Symbol | Description                               |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| AND      | `&`    | Each bit is 1 if both bits are 1          |
| OR       | `|`    | Each bit is 1 if at least one bit is 1    |
| XOR      | `^`    | Each bit is 1 if only one bit is 1        |
